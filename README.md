# Washing Machine Verilog Implementation

## Overview
This Verilog module implements a washing machine and  involves designing a control system that manages the various operations of the washing machine. This project typically uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) model to control the different states and operations of the washing machine.

## Features
- Automatic Detergent and Softener Dispenser.
- Multiple Washing Cycles.
- Reset feature-Allows the user to restart the washing machine, clearing any current settings or errors, and returning the machine to its initial state.
- Auto Door Lock: Automatically lock the door during operation and only unlock when the cycle is complete for safety.
